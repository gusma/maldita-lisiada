## About Maldita Lisiada

[Maldita Lisiada](https://maldita-lisiada.vercel.app) is a revamp of a [previously created website](https://web.archive.org/web/20120815000000*/malditalisiada.com.ar) that used to exist up until 2013-2014. It bases off of [Soraya Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soraya_Montenegro)'s fictional character in latin novel [Mar√≠a La del Barrio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_la_del_Barrio). Just for a few giggles this website as well as its properties were revived.

## Stack

This has been made with pure [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), along with [React-Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet), [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [SASS]().

## Getting Started

To install this app, first install your dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And after that run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## To dos: 

Albeit pretty much done, this project could do with some finessing:

* Perhaps, moving into CSS-in-js. (Styled components?)
* Migrating the audio player for a one-instance-at-a-time player only.
* Finding solutions to preload audio instead of loading on play.
* Reducing app load altogether.
* Implementing service workers to make this into a fully formed PWA.
